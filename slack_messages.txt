    [12/06/2024 11:11] **Busch** (reply): Thoughts on getting to 5 mil from o1

If you use the Small Team plan as a benchmark (2-10 users at $20/user/month), let’s pick 10 users per team for a clear scenario.

That’s $200/month per team or $2,400/year per team.

To reach $5 million in annual revenue, you’d need about:
$5,000,000 / $2,400 ≈ 2,083 small teams (each with 10 users). That totals around 20,830 users.

Alternatively, if you rely on individuals at $25/month (about $300/year each), you’d need roughly:
$5,000,000 / $300 ≈ 16,667 individual subscribers. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733501501983909

    [12/06/2024 11:27] **Miles** (reply): pinned this for visibility @Aubrey @Busch. per our conversatiom this morning, i think the question for today is what are all the boxes we need to check for that first bullet point? 

i think we can probably just update our all hands shaping document with what we know now and that'll get us pretty close [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733502479406809

[12/06/2024 02:32] **Miles**: the tribe people are fantastic. noah, orges, prem, carlos, and walt are all super cool people. incredibly smart. very awesome conversations and common ground 

they invited me to dinner, had some very cool cognitive architecture discussions around different species of intelligence, and then we went to the weezer and zedd shows together

[12/05/2024 13:11] **Miles**: loved the tiktok edit personally if not too difficult. let's see what @Ben Ortega thinks of this iteration first though

thank you thank you @Busch you're amazing :muscle: [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733422261896479

[12/05/2024 13:01] **Busch**: starts with convo - then goes to summary - them cal event shows up with no click required [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733421672172789

[12/05/2024 12:59] **Miles**: i proposed the clicking this morning based on my intuition about the workflow @Ben Ortega. was starting to feel like that ux felt right as i was walking thru it last night and this morning. happy to align on that point

that's part of what @Brent and i can discuss in just a bit as well [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733421595665799

[12/05/2024 12:55] **Ben Ortega**: Closer. 

The vid starts with viewing the conversation that happened. I think video needs to start with viewing the live conversation between two or more people. 

Hey Miles. 
Hey Ben. 
Miles can you find time to review Slack AI. 
Sure!

Then pan to the summary that was generated showing the discussion about the task. 

I thought task would automatically pop to assigned person vs requiring someone to “click task” to make it pop to the calendar? That adds human processing vs a discussion summary handling it on the human’s behalf. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733421306203279

[12/05/2024 12:36] **Miles**: what do you think of some editing magic that makes the calendar event sparkle or radiate some cool effect when it populates @Busch ? [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733420173052809

[12/05/2024 12:35] **Ben Ortega**: Yes. I think folks need to see it as a new task derived from convo in channel to daily summation. With that magical POP! [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733420129466479

[12/05/2024 12:29] **Miles**: cool, is this the right interpretation of your feedback @Ben Ortega? i'm hearing: you want to see the conversation, then the summary, and have the calendar up the whole time. like a slight reordering of the script and presentation [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733419754838459

[12/05/2024 12:21] **Ben Ortega**: Closer. 

I think video needs something in the project channel being discussed between two people, and in that thread a “hey Miles can you enable Slack AI so we can test it” mentioned. That is highlighted for viewer to see. 

Then move to summarization channel and see the “next step task”. With the calendar window on side showing the new “Slack AI” task popping to calendar. You may have to have the calendar up the whole time so viewers can see no task, and then new task to help them see the automation.
