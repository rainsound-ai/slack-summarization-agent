[12/04/2024 17:05] **Miles**: we've known about the slack ai for awhile btw. it's just so much more robust to build off our own solutions when possible and we hadn't yet committed in this direction

that being said, probably time to go ahead and press go on setting up our acct to use it so we know what we're trying to beat

@Aubrey would you mind setting that up for everyone when you get a chance please? [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733349907460129

Also, I tried to find the Slack AI summation option in our instance and couldn’t find it. Maybe an admin setting or enabling a marketplace tool to the instance.

    [12/04/2024 14:23] **Brent** (reply): Could the above data be done by opt in? Like curated but prompted if you wanted a deeper dive? 

Which reminds me: also woke up in the middle of the night thinking about our exec summary doing some “works cited” slots for easy links/access to exact thread content? If we haven’t already, that is. I just remembered this :joy:  

Yes. Yes. I’m dreaming about it now. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733340196423459

    [12/04/2024 14:35] **Miles** (reply): similar to this, but links to the context and resources from which the insights/actionables are derived? @Brent [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733340943331399

    [12/04/2024 14:56] **Brent** (reply): Yeah. Would be great to have a little 1, 2, 3 works cited that are able to be linked to content and context especially if it takes within context. 

In smaller context it’s not as necessary, but some large executives (primarily using teams platform) may have a lot of context to explore and to be able to be taken to that data quickly could be huge efficiency value add for the exec [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733342167145859

    [12/04/2024 14:57] **Brent** (reply): So in this where it says in progress, a quick link that says “go to thread” that’s able to be linked to the exact thread this was summarized from? [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733342255295619

    [12/04/2024 15:36] **Ben Ortega** (reply): Would the quick insight be used to output what we tested or for clients?? Not sure what you’re thinking with it? For the task item itself? 

It is pretty. If for a task, that might be long form but that’s a guess. We won’t know if it’s good until a client sees it and give info about it [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733344565727679

    [12/04/2024 16:45] **Miles** (reply): i think quicksight has a really nice generative BI dashboard UI and output formats for executive summaries. if we're compressing our slack summary into various links for length, data stories, for example, can be a nice way of presenting all of the relevant context for any given next step. happy to add more color and clarity to that in person later if helpful :relaxed: [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733348714907509

[12/04/2024 12:33] **Brent**: A thought. Not sure it’s a novel idea:

High value on our UX to be as clear and concise as possible for our target market. If target is executive and business leaders, the technicality has to be on the backend not on the client/end-user. Keeping it as simple as possible to deploy, use, and engage with is prime opportunity in the UX. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733333626353829

    [12/04/2024 11:45] **Miles** (reply): cool, ben was just saying that's the magic line to cross. as soon as it does the automatic pop onto calendar thing, we can show people and blow their minds. 

was curious if possible to have that today or tomorrow for some meetings we'll be having (one is with Noah from tribe actually). but no sweat if not :relaxed: [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733330759247169
