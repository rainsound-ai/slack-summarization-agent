[12/05/2024 12:29] **Miles**: cool, is this the right interpretation of your feedback @Ben Ortega? i'm hearing: you want to see the conversation, then the summary, and have the calendar up the whole time. like a slight reordering of the script and presentation [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733419754838459

[12/05/2024 12:21] **Ben Ortega**: Closer. 

I think video needs something in the project channel being discussed between two people, and in that thread a “hey Miles can you enable Slack AI so we can test it” mentioned. That is highlighted for viewer to see. 

Then move to summarization channel and see the “next step task”. With the calendar window on side showing the new “Slack AI” task popping to calendar. You may have to have the calendar up the whole time so viewers can see no task, and then new task to help them see the automation.

[12/05/2024 11:29] **Miles**: idea (just for brainstorming, not to shake anything up we're currently doing):

if we can create a schedule next step button or the like, i wonder if what we actually want is the ability to schedule a next step based off of a variety of slack interactions. here's what i mean by 'interactions'

• schedule a next step based on a daily hyperpersonalized executive summary (what we're currently doing)
• schedule a next step based on the specific outcomes of a meeting. this could be done from the meeting summary itself
• schedule a next step based on a specific thread or channel
• schedule a next step based on the contents of a slack canvas
i think those other interactions are genuinely places in which next steps emerge for us

the moonshot goal in my mind is that every person in the company always knows what their next step is so there's minimal alignment overhead and everyone can just cook [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733416158898299

I would agree with this statement. Like we talked about last night a bit at the table... This is what would allow those dashboards to really be effective if everyone was dialed in. Dashboards create organizational accountability I'd argue to help leaders know if something is slipping or ahead of schedule ... etc [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733416760114129

[12/05/2024 11:01] **Miles**: @Ben Ortega just met with @Aubrey and @Busch 

we should have the next iteration of a demo video soon. we came up with some more ideas since we talked this morning:


• planning on showing the summary at the start
• then click a citation link relevant to the next step and show the messages from which it was derived 
• then click a 'schedule next step' button to make the calendar population extra visual [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733414490226909

[12/04/2024 19:35] **Miles**: the details sections waste the first bullet point just reiterating what the main blurb already said

it's also just a pure summary with no recommendations, next steps, etc etc

only use case i can see for this is if i just came back from a break and was ok missing out on substantial amounts of detail rather than just reading the actual messages [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733358922395729

    [12/04/2024 19:07] **Luca** (reply): Agreed that this is very important.

First is to dial in really good defaults. We’ll probably want some task decomposition here rather than just asking the model, “summarize this.”

Second, we might consider giving users some control over this. For example, an “expand” link / button after each bullet point that fleshes out that item. A “detail” slider is kind of a similar vibe for each bullet point, but we probably don’t need that level of granularity.

    [12/04/2024 16:32] **Luca** (reply): We can also address those questions head-on. “Here’s how we compare to Slack AI and why we’re a better option.” [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733347934651709

    [12/04/2024 16:33] **Brent** (reply): Great point 

Side by side offerings slide/graphic comes to mind for website or information packet/sales decks [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733347988762029

    [12/04/2024 16:38] **Ben Ortega** (reply): I wouldn’t stand behind the Slack AI, especially seeing that they are here encouraging folks to use Amazon Q to do summaries and access knowledge. Also, I tried to find the Slack AI summation option in our instance and couldn’t find it. Maybe an admin setting or enabling a marketplace tool to the instance.

    [12/04/2024 17:52] **Miles** (reply): the daily recap doesn't seem even close to our executive summary at first blush. you can see a gif of it in the link luca posted above. will have to try it to be sure, but i genuinely don't think there's anything to be concerned about here

our thing is way different than theirs [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733352727662919

    [12/04/2024 14:10] **Miles** (reply): our slack agent could link to something like this if you want additional detail on the next step that's going on your calendar [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733339434724969

    [12/04/2024 14:15] **Miles** (reply): going to put it in the tool auditing queue @Ian @Luca, but just to say it here: i think we should start using/harvesting quicksight asap. it's both useful to our data-driven decision making as well as for inspiring our approach to the next step agent [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733339737970319

    [12/04/2024 14:23] **Brent** (reply): Could the above data be done by opt in? Like curated but prompted if you wanted a deeper dive? 

Which reminds me: also woke up in the middle of the night thinking about our exec summary doing some “works cited” slots for easy links/access to exact thread content? If we haven’t already, that is. I just remembered this :joy:  

Yes. Yes. I’m dreaming about it now. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733340196423459

    [12/04/2024 14:31] **Busch** (reply): great idea! [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733340718007769

    [12/04/2024 14:35] **Miles** (reply): similar to this, but links to the context and resources from which the insights/actionables are derived? @Brent [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733340943331399

    [12/04/2024 14:56] **Brent** (reply): Yeah. Would be great to have a little 1, 2, 3 works cited that are able to be linked to content and context especially if it takes within context. 

In smaller context it’s not as necessary, but some large executives (primarily using teams platform) may have a lot of context to explore and to be able to be taken to that data quickly could be huge efficiency value add for the exec [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733342167145859

    [12/04/2024 14:57] **Brent** (reply): So in this where it says in progress, a quick link that says “go to thread” that’s able to be linked to the exact thread this was summarized from? [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733342255295619

    [12/04/2024 15:36] **Ben Ortega** (reply): Would the quick insight be used to output what we tested or for clients?? Not sure what you’re thinking with it? For the task item itself? 

It is pretty. If for a task, that might be long form but that’s a guess. We won’t know if it’s good until a client sees it and give info about it [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733344565727679

    [12/04/2024 15:57] **Busch** (reply): I can try to add support for message links on bullet points and we can figure that out [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733345832289389

    [12/04/2024 15:57] **Busch** (reply): If that sounds like a good way to go [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733345853801729

    [12/04/2024 16:45] **Miles** (reply): i think quicksight has a really nice generative BI dashboard UI and output formats for executive summaries. if we're compressing our slack summary into various links for length, data stories, for example, can be a nice way of presenting all of the relevant context for any given next step. happy to add more color and clarity to that in person later if helpful :relaxed: [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733348714907509

[12/04/2024 12:33] **Brent**: A thought. Not sure it’s a novel idea:

High value on our UX to be as clear and concise as possible for our target market. If target is executive and business leaders, the technicality has to be on the backend not on the client/end-user. Keeping it as simple as possible to deploy, use, and engage with is prime opportunity in the UX. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733333626353829
