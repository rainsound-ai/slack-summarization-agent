[12/04/2024 17:05] **Miles**: we've known about the slack ai for awhile btw. it's just so much more robust to build off our own solutions when possible and we hadn't yet committed in this direction

that being said, probably time to go ahead and press go on setting up our acct to use it so we know what we're trying to beat

 would you mind setting that up for everyone when you get a chance please?

    [12/04/2024 17:10] **Miles** (reply): when i saw it last, it primarily summarized individual channels. the daily recap bit is fresh i think, maybe as new or newer than our thing

[12/04/2024 16:04] **Busch**: Makes sense - im sure slack is going to roll out something similar soon that’s native

[Thread started]

    [12/04/2024 16:05] **Brent** (reply): Sounds like it’s just summary type stuff

    [12/04/2024 16:23] **Luca** (reply): They already have :relaxed:

<https://slack.com/features/ai>

    [12/04/2024 16:27] **Brent** (reply): Marketing brain engaged: why is ours uniquely better? So slack did a thing, cool. But ours is better and here is why. And that why is worth $25-$100/month/user … etc.

    [12/04/2024 16:28] **Brent** (reply): Value proposition is this… etc.

    [12/04/2024 16:28] **Luca** (reply): Yup, that’s the question for sure

    [12/04/2024 16:29] **Luca** (reply): The obvious answer is “we look beyond just Slack at things like meeting recordings”. But there are other value propositions too.

    [12/04/2024 16:29] **Brent** (reply): We have the opportunity to create value in amazing ways that surpasses slacks summary 

We also may be able to leverage their summary concept to a degree to gather opportunity notes ?

    [12/04/2024 16:30] **Brent** (reply): Next steps recommendation 
Calendar integration 
Context citations 

All of these are value adds that put our slack (and future productivity engagements) uniquely better

[End of thread]

[12/04/2024 16:03] **Brent**: Slack AI the same thing as far as our summary data? They just said something about it in this Salesforce convo

[Thread started]

    [12/04/2024 16:04] **Brent** (reply): Agentforce info as well

    [12/04/2024 16:23] **Luca** (reply): Definitely some overlap:

<https://slack.com/features/ai>

    [12/04/2024 16:31] **Brent** (reply): Strategically positioning ourselves and value adds will eliminate any comparison I think

    [12/04/2024 16:32] **Luca** (reply): We can also address those questions head-on. “Here’s how we compare to Slack AI and why we’re a better option.”

    [12/04/2024 16:33] **Brent** (reply): Great point 

Side by side offerings slide/graphic comes to mind for website or information packet/sales decks

    [12/04/2024 16:38] **Ben Ortega** (reply): I wouldn’t stand behind the Slack AI, especially seeing that they are here encouraging folks to use Amazon Q to do summaries and access knowledge. Also, I tried to find the Slack AI summation option in our instance and couldn’t find it. Maybe an admin setting or enabling a marketplace tool to the instance.

    [12/04/2024 16:39] **Brent** (reply): Totally agree with you, Ben, I just don’t want us to get out there and pretend or not acknowledge of this exist.

    [12/04/2024 16:39] **Miles** (reply): let's take inspiration from it and then beat it

    [12/04/2024 13:53] **Miles** (reply): i think this format rocks

data story might be a good thing to copy for next step agent

    [12/04/2024 13:55] **Miles** (reply): 'quicksight for slack' (with auto-populating calendar features) isn't too far off in a lot of ways

    [12/04/2024 13:58] **Miles** (reply): here it is in screenshot form:

    [12/04/2024 13:59] **Miles** (reply): you can also turn it into a slide deck

    [12/04/2024 13:59] **Brent** (reply): Screenshots came through. Couldn’t get to the link view

    [12/04/2024 14:09] **Miles** (reply): what do you think of that data story format?

    [12/04/2024 14:10] **Miles** (reply): our slack agent could link to something like this if you want additional detail on the next step that's going on your calendar

    [12/04/2024 14:11] **Busch** (reply): Super cool

    [12/04/2024 14:15] **Miles** (reply): going to put it in the tool auditing queue  , but just to say it here: i think we should start using/harvesting quicksight asap. it's both useful to our data-driven decision making as well as for inspiring our approach to the next step agent

    [12/04/2024 14:23] **Brent** (reply): Could the above data be done by opt in? Like curated but prompted if you wanted a deeper dive? 

Which reminds me: also woke up in the middle of the night thinking about our exec summary doing some “works cited” slots for easy links/access to exact thread content? If we haven’t already, that is. I just remembered this :joy:  

Yes. Yes. I’m dreaming about it now.

    [12/04/2024 14:31] **Busch** (reply): great idea!

    [12/04/2024 14:35] **Miles** (reply): similar to this, but links to the context and resources from which the insights/actionables are derived?

    [12/04/2024 14:56] **Brent** (reply): Yeah. Would be great to have a little 1, 2, 3 works cited that are able to be linked to content and context especially if it takes within context. 

In smaller context it’s not as necessary, but some large executives (primarily using teams platform) may have a lot of context to explore and to be able to be taken to that data quickly could be huge efficiency value add for the exec

    [12/04/2024 14:57] **Brent** (reply): So in this where it says in progress, a quick link that says “go to thread” that’s able to be linked to the exact thread this was summarized from?

    [12/04/2024 15:36] **Ben Ortega** (reply): Would the quick insight be used to output what we tested or for clients?? Not sure what you’re thinking with it? For the task item itself? 

It is pretty. If for a task, that might be long form but that’s a guess. We won’t know if it’s good until a client sees it and give info about it

    [12/04/2024 15:57] **Busch** (reply): I can try to add support for message links on bullet points and we can figure that out

    [12/04/2024 15:57] **Busch** (reply): If that sounds like a good way to go

    [12/04/2024 16:45] **Miles** (reply): i think quicksight has a really nice generative BI dashboard UI and output formats for executive summaries. if we're compressing our slack summary into various links for length, data stories, for example, can be a nice way of presenting all of the relevant context for any given next step. happy to add more color and clarity to that in person later if helpful :relaxed:

[End of thread]

[12/04/2024 12:33] **Brent**: A thought. Not sure it’s a novel idea:

High value on our UX to be as clear and concise as possible for our target market. If target is executive and business leaders, the technicality has to be on the backend not on the client/end-user. Keeping it as simple as possible to deploy, use, and engage with is prime opportunity in the UX.

[12/04/2024 12:11] **Busch**: Dope stuff!

    [12/04/2024 12:13] **Busch** (reply): Not that you can use AWS services using natural language I’m no longer scared of using them -
Historically the DX has been nightmarish - sound like from the talk last night you can just tell it generally what you want now.
I bet those new tools like Q and Bedrock have a fantastic DX too

    [12/04/2024 12:14] **Miles** (reply): they do, i was frankly impressed. already built some stuff with them. i think we should harvest their approach, ui, and feature set for our own proprietary tools

    [12/04/2024 12:25] **Miles** (reply): creating an iteration proposal our tool auditing pipeline. an SOP like 'harvesting tools for inspiration' for when we don't necessarily want to full on adopt a tool

    [12/04/2024 12:26] **Miles** (reply): 'scenarios' and 'topics'. cool concepts imo

    [12/04/2024 12:29] **Miles** (reply): <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/gen-bi-author-q-and-a.html>

    [12/04/2024 12:32] **Miles** (reply): this app actually rocks

    [12/04/2024 12:42] **Busch** (reply): you wouldnt know from looking at it! I see they still havnt done anything to improve the shitty ui

    [12/04/2024 12:43] **Busch** (reply): cool

    [12/04/2024 12:55] **Miles** (reply): just built this dashboard

    [12/04/2024 13:20] **Busch** (reply): dope

    [12/04/2024 13:45] **Miles** (reply): this is sick. highly relevant to what we're doing since we're creating executive summaries based off slack and other context

    [12/04/2024 13:49] **Miles** (reply): another example
