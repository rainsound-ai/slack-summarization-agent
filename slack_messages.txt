    [12/06/2024 11:29] **Busch** (reply): Same! Months of progress every day is just incredible. @Miles @Brent and @Ben Ortega y’all rock!
Thanks for crushing so hard this week! Grateful to be working together [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733502583125509

    [12/06/2024 12:30] **Brent** (reply): It was a great decision on the team to make a move toward this.

I'd love to note, there is a lot of synergy flowing between sales, product and business dev....

But NONE of that would be possible if y'all weren't crushing in the back making moves @Busch @Luca @Aubrey @Ian

This week was a great team effort and it is looking like this whole team is in great unity. Well done y'all!

The best is yet to come! [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733506218428269

    [12/06/2024 11:11] **Busch** (reply): Thoughts on getting to 5 mil from o1

If you use the Small Team plan as a benchmark (2-10 users at $20/user/month), let’s pick 10 users per team for a clear scenario.

That’s $200/month per team or $2,400/year per team.

To reach $5 million in annual revenue, you’d need about:
$5,000,000 / $2,400 ≈ 2,083 small teams (each with 10 users). That totals around 20,830 users.

Alternatively, if you rely on individuals at $25/month (about $300/year each), you’d need roughly:
$5,000,000 / $300 ≈ 16,667 individual subscribers. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733501501983909

    [12/06/2024 11:19] **Ben Ortega** (reply): early design, and thanks for the input. We'll continue internal discussions on it all so we are set us up for success. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733501979385119

    [12/06/2024 11:20] **Ben Ortega** (reply): btw... if you view <http://builtwith.com|builtwith.com> you'll see there are 2.8M sites that use slack: <https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Slack/Historical> [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733502052744899

    [12/06/2024 12:28] **Brent** (reply): That means our TAM would be 2.8M companies!

with the way this thing works, let's estimate a goal of 25% adoption rate out the gate... puts us at a couple hundred thousand users which would be a phenomenal adoption rate to start with [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733506085840019

    [12/06/2024 11:27] **Miles** (reply): pinned this for visibility @Aubrey @Busch. per our conversatiom this morning, i think the question for today is what are all the boxes we need to check for that first bullet point? 

i think we can probably just update our all hands shaping document with what we know now and that'll get us pretty close [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733502479406809

    [12/06/2024 12:25] **Brent** (reply): @Miles are we still aligned on the "idea dump" convo we had?

For clarity: wanting to give everyone an opportunity to dump all of their ideas, so Miles and I can create that roadmap with the end in mind. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733505946146859

thank you thank you @Busch you're amazing :muscle: [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733422261896479

[12/05/2024 12:59] **Miles**: i proposed the clicking this morning based on my intuition about the workflow @Ben Ortega. was starting to feel like that ux felt right as i was walking thru it last night and this morning. happy to align on that point

that's part of what @Brent and i can discuss in just a bit as well [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733421595665799

[12/05/2024 12:55] **Ben Ortega**: Closer. 

The vid starts with viewing the conversation that happened. I think video needs to start with viewing the live conversation between two or more people. 

Hey Miles. 
Hey Ben. 
Miles can you find time to review Slack AI. 
Sure!

Then pan to the summary that was generated showing the discussion about the task. 

I thought task would automatically pop to assigned person vs requiring someone to “click task” to make it pop to the calendar? That adds human processing vs a discussion summary handling it on the human’s behalf. [Message URL]: https://yourworkspace.slack.com/archives/C06887AJJNN/p1733421306203279
